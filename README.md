## Project Description 

Our project focuses on visualing Dijkstra and A* on a grid-like graph, and highlighting the efficiency of A* for single-source single-destination applications

## Technical Details

1. Both Algorithms were written in C++ and use Queues as data structues 

2. Additionally A* uses Heap priority queue

## Instructions
